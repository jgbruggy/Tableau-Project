# Tableau-Project
Simple project using Tableau to display video game sales/review info from 1980-2016

A simple project that I used to learn the basics of Tableau.

Sheet 1 compares the number of critics vs the number of players in each major genre over a 20 year period.
Sheet 2 shows the expansions of video game critics from 1996-2016 and how it effected average review scores.
Sheet 3 shows compares game sales in Japan, North America, and Europe. Also the data is split up over the top 10 game companies for this period.
Sheet 4 shows total sales divided by country from 1980-2016 to show how the markets have changed.
